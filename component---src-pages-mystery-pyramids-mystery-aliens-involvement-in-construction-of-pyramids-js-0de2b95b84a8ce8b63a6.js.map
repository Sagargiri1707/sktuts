The stars of Orion were associated with Osiris, the god of rebirth and afterlife by the ancient Egyptians.Depending on the version of the theory, additional pyramids can be included to complete the data of the Orion constellation, and the Nile river can be included to match with the Milky Way galaxy. The theory was first published in 1989 in Discussions in Egyptology, volume 13. It was the subject of a bestseller, The Orion Mystery, in 1994, as well as a BBC documentary, The Great Pyramid: Gateway to the Stars (February 1994), and appears in some new-age books.\"/>\r\n                            <br/>\r\n                            Some theorists believe that aliens from these three stars came down to earth and helped the egyptians to build these magnificient structures with the help of technologies the brought with them.<br/>\r\n                            No one knows who build the pyramids, is it aliens or egyptians or both but surely there is some connection of the pyramids to the external stars\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <h2>Tunnels in pyramids</h2>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            The pyramids are itself a big mystery and the tunnels inside it make the things more complicated and mysterious.They have made tunnels almost everywhere inside the pyramids.Initially what people thought was it is constructed only for ventilation but slowly this theory was ruled out because a robot when sent inside with a camera noted that they were closed and a door like knob was present there so how come is it made for ventilation.These chambers sepatrated the pyramids into many chambers out of which 3 have been discovered the lower one called the Base chamber, the middle one the queens chamber and the topmost one the kings chamber. \r\n                            <br/>\r\n                            <img src={chambers}   alt=\"There are three known chambers inside the Great Pyramid.

The so-called Queen's Chamber and King's Chamber are higher up within the pyramid structure.\"/>\r\n                            <br/>\r\n                            <p>If you enter the pyramids with any the two tunnels on the top you can explore the whole pyramids but the fact is that no one was able to discover it completely.It is to be noted that it is said discovered chambers not the total number of chambers.No one exactly how many chambers are there.</p>\r\n                            <h4><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_shafts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Star Shaft theory</a></h4>\r\n                            <p>\r\n                                Another theory made by many theorists says that the tunnels were constructed such that when  the king's body was kept in the pyramids then their souls can go to these stars directly.Have a glance at this image.\r\n                                <img   src={star} alt=\"Star shafts are narrow ducts leading out of ancient structures such as the Egyptian pyramids and Baalbek. The shafts start inside the Kings Chamber of the Great Pyramid of Giza, and exit at the same height. Alexandre M. Badawy suggested that the shafts pointed to Orion's Belt during the period of the construction of the Giza complex.[1] It is thought that these openings were perhaps air vents for mummies or built to point to certain stars at the date of the pyramids construction\"/>\r\n                                When remote controlled camera cars were sent inside the queens chamber it was found that it is closed and like it was constructed such that no one should be able to enter it.Many theorists still believe that there are many more chambers yet to be discovered.Once a small camera was drilled into the queens chamber but it got destroyed mysteriously and after that the government of Egypt stopped any further exploration of the pyramids and made it illegal.\r\n\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <h2>Why was Pyramids built</h2>\r\n                        <p>According to many theorists the pyramids were constructed to bury the mummies of the kings and queens .Mummies are the dead body of peoples wrapped in linen and kept in tombstones with their bodies dried completely.But do you know how many mummies were found in the pyramids? Shockingly the answer is zero.No king's tomb was found on king's chamber and no queen's tomb on queen's chamber.<br/>\r\n                            Many theorists still believe that pyramids were constructed for an entirely different purpose and not for burying.Even some believe it was built for aliens to work and live in earth.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <h2>Locations of pyramids</h2>\r\n                        <p>Do you know the locations of pyramids well ofcourse no but if calculate whole surface of earth and find its geographical center then you would get the position as the exact position of pyramids.Ofcourse this can be a co-incidence but just think 4,000 years ago when no one knew about geography even they didnt know that earth was round then how did the pyramids were constructed.</p>\r\n                        <p>Another fact which may disturb you is that the north side of the pyramid is in exact alignment with the geographical north pole with just some few kilometers away which may be due to tectonic plate movements over the years otherwise it would be in perfectly aligned position.</p>\r\n\r\n                        <h2>Pyramid stones</h2>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            The stones used in pyramids were much harder and durable than the modern day stones.Many Scientists have taken the samples of these stones but none of them was able to find the exact specification of the stone.These stones are like limestone but not exactly lime stone.Also this type of stone is never found anywhere else in any part of earth.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <h2>Construction technologies</h2>\r\n                        <p>The pyramids were constructed using the modern ball and socket method.This method is effective against the expansion and contaction due to sun's heat in the extreme temperature.This technology is also used nowadays for earthquake resistant buildings.Just imagine earthquake resistant buildings 4000 years ago</p>\r\n                        <h3>Natural AC in basement</h3>\r\n                        <p>Also the pyramids were constructed such that in the desert even when the temperature is 50 degree celsius the temperature of the basement of pyramid remains at a whooping constant of 20 degree celsius.It will same for the whole year both in day and night .Just think of the technology used there 4,000 years ago.</p>\r\n                        <p>Do you think the facts like natural ACs,earthquake resistance,orion star alignment,north pole facing without compass is just a co-incidence or there were some mystical and powerful force behind it who had this great technology 4,000 years ago.\r\n                        </p>\r\n
